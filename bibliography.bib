	abstract="Automatic speaker verification systems have achieved great performance and been widely adopted in many security applications. One of the important requirements for the verification system is its resilience to spoofing attacks, such as impersonation, replay, speech synthesis and voice conversion. Among these attacks, speech synthesis has a high risk to the verification systems. In this paper, a novel detection method for computer-generated speech, especially for HMM synthetic speech, is proposed. It is found that the wavelet coefficients in specified position show the obvious difference between the synthetic and natural speech. The logarithmic spectrum features are extracted from the wavelet coefficients and support vector machine is used as the classifier to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm. The experimental results over SAS corpus show that the proposed algorithm can achieve high detection accuracy and low equal error rate.",

	abstract="Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are highly vulnerable against spoofing attacks. Anti-spoofing, determining whether a speech signal is natural/genuine or spoofed, is very important for improving the reliability of the ASV systems. Spoofing attacks using the speech signals generated using speech synthesis and voice conversion have recently received great interest due to the 2015 edition of Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge (ASVspoof 2015). In this paper, we propose to use linear prediction (LP) residual based features for anti-spoofing. Three different features extracted from LP residual signal were compared using the ASVspoof 2015 database. Experimental results indicate that LP residual phase cepstral coefficients (LPRPC) and LP residual Hilbert envelope cepstral coefficients (LPRHEC) obtained from the analytic signal of the LP residual yield promising results for anti-spoofing. The proposed features are found to outperform standard Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and Cosine Phase (CosPhase) features. LPRPC and LPRHEC features give the smallest equal error rates (EER) for eight spoofing methods out of ten spoofing attacks in comparison to MFCC and CosPhase features.",

	reverberation and channel information from non-voiced (silence and

	using a voice activity detector. These non-voiced segments are likely to
	contain reverberation and channel information. Multiple feature
	representations are used to capture the remnant vocal tract information
	in non-voiced segments. Gaussian mixture models are used to build three
	different baseline systems corresponding to that of three different
	features. Voting is performed to decide whether a given input utterance
	is replayed or not. Equal error rate (EER) is computed using the
	likelihood ratio of the genuine and spoofed model from the best baseline
	system. Evaluation on the ASV-Spoof-2017 challenge dataset shows that
	the proposed approach outperforms the best baseline system with a
	relative improvement of 37\% in terms of EER.}},

	abstract = "Recent evaluations such as ASVspoof 2015 and the similarly-named AVspoof have stimulated a great deal of progress to develop spoofing countermeasures for automatic speaker verification. This paper reports an approach which combines speech signal analysis using the constant Q transform with traditional cepstral processing. The resulting constant Q cepstral coefficients (CQCCs) were introduced recently and have proven to be an effective spoofing countermeasure. An extension of previous work, the paper reports an assessment of CQCCs generalisation across three different databases and shows that they deliver state-of-the-art performance in each case. The benefit of CQCC features stems from a variable spectro-temporal resolution which, while being fundamentally different to that used by most automatic speaker verification system front-ends, also captures reliably the tell-tale signs of manipulation artefacts which are indicative of spoofing attacks. The second contribution relates to a cross-database evaluation. Results show that CQCC configuration is sensitive to the general form of spoofing attack and use case scenario. This finding suggests that the past single-system pursuit of generalised spoofing detection may need rethinking."
