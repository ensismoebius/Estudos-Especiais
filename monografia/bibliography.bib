	abstract="Automatic speaker verification systems have achieved great performance and been widely adopted in many security applications. One of the important requirements for the verification system is its resilience to spoofing attacks, such as impersonation, replay, speech synthesis and voice conversion. Among these attacks, speech synthesis has a high risk to the verification systems. In this paper, a novel detection method for computer-generated speech, especially for HMM synthetic speech, is proposed. It is found that the wavelet coefficients in specified position show the obvious difference between the synthetic and natural speech. The logarithmic spectrum features are extracted from the wavelet coefficients and support vector machine is used as the classifier to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm. The experimental results over SAS corpus show that the proposed algorithm can achieve high detection accuracy and low equal error rate.",

	abstract="Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are highly vulnerable against spoofing attacks. Anti-spoofing, determining whether a speech signal is natural/genuine or spoofed, is very important for improving the reliability of the ASV systems. Spoofing attacks using the speech signals generated using speech synthesis and voice conversion have recently received great interest due to the 2015 edition of Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge (ASVspoof 2015). In this paper, we propose to use linear prediction (LP) residual based features for anti-spoofing. Three different features extracted from LP residual signal were compared using the ASVspoof 2015 database. Experimental results indicate that LP residual phase cepstral coefficients (LPRPC) and LP residual Hilbert envelope cepstral coefficients (LPRHEC) obtained from the analytic signal of the LP residual yield promising results for anti-spoofing. The proposed features are found to outperform standard Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and Cosine Phase (CosPhase) features. LPRPC and LPRHEC features give the smallest equal error rates (EER) for eight spoofing methods out of ten spoofing attacks in comparison to MFCC and CosPhase features.",

This paper reports an approach which combines speech signal analysis using the constant Q transform with traditional cepstral processing. The resulting constant Q cepstral coefficients (CQCCs) were introduced recently and have proven to be an effective spoofing countermeasure. An extension of previous work, the paper reports an assessment of CQCCs generalisation across three different databases and shows that they deliver state-of-the-art performance in each case. The benefit of CQCC features stems from a variable spectro-temporal resolution which, while being fundamentally different to that used by most automatic speaker verification system front-ends, also captures reliably the tell-tale signs of manipulation artefacts which are indicative of spoofing attacks. The second contribution relates to a cross-database evaluation. Results show that CQCC configuration is sensitive to the general form of spoofing attack and use case scenario. This finding suggests that the past single-system pursuit of generalised spoofing detection may need rethinking."

	acoustic environment and distortions of intermediate device. Thus, the
	noise added in replayed speech is important to detect. The Amplitude
	Modulations (AM) are more susceptible to noise and multipath
	interferences that may result due to replay mechanism. The experiments
	are performed on various dependency index (DI) and lower EER of 6.12 \%

	2017 Challenge database. Furthermore, we compare our results with CQCC,
	LFCC, MFCC, and VESA-IFCC feature sets. The score-level fusion VESA-IFCC

	types of spoofing attacks such as speech synthesis, voice conversion and
	replay attacks. Recent research has highlighted the need for more
	effective countermeasures for replay attacks, which can be very
	challenging to detect, however replayed speech has previously shown
	frequency band-specific differences when compared with genuine speech.
	In this paper, we propose the use of long-term temporal envelopes of
	subband signals using a frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP)
	framework. This flexible framework makes use of temporal envelope
	information, which has not previously been investigated for replay
	spoofing detection. Evaluations of the proposed system and its fusion
	with other subsystems were carried out on the ASVspoof 2017 database.
	Interestingly, smoother temporal envelopes, based on very long windows
	of up to 1 second, seem to be most successful and show good prospects
	for performance improvements via fusion.}},

	Abstract = {{Speech Synthesis (SS) and Voice Conversion (VC) methods provides a great
	risk for Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) system. In this paper, we
	tried to find the difference between natural and spoofed speech signals
	using Teager Energy Operator-based Energy Separation Algorithm
	(TEO-ESA). Here, we exploit the contribution of Amplitude Envelope (AE)
	and Instantaneous Frequency (IF) in each narrowband filtered signals
	energy via ESA to capture possible changes in a temporal and spectral
	envelope of the synthetic speech signal generated by the machines as
	opposed to natural signals. Furthermore, IF was used for classification
	of natural vs. spoof speech with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a
	classifier. These findings may assist to distinguish these two speeches
	and provide an aid to alleviate possible impostor attacks in voice
	biometrics. The experiments are done on ASV Spoof 2015 Challenge
	database. We have compared proposed Energy Separation
	Algorithm-Instantaneous Frequency Cosine Coefficients (ESA-IFCC) with
	Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features. On the development
	set, MFCC alone gave an Equal Error Rate (EER) of (6.98 \%) and ESA-IFCC
	gave (5.43 \%) with 13-D static features. With score level fusion of
	MFCC and ESA-IFCC EER reduced to 3.45 \% on static feature vector. The
	EER decreases further to 2.01 \% and 1.89 \% for Delta and Delta Delta
	features. On evaluation set, the overall average error rate for known
	and unknown attacks was 6.79 \% for ESA-IFCC and was significantly
	better than the MFCC (9.15 \%) and their score-level fused EER (7.16
	\%).}},

	Abstract = {{Voice spooling is one of the major challenges that needs to be addressed
	in the development of robust speaker verification (SV) systems.
	Therefore, it is necessary to develop systems (spoofing detectors) that
	are able distinguish between genuine and spoofed speech utterances. In
	this work, we propose the use of modified gammatone frequency cepstral
	coefficients (MGFCC) on enhancing the performance of spoofing detection.
	We also compare the effectiveness of GMM based spooling detectors
	developed using mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), gammatone
	frequency cepstral coefficients (GFCC), modified group delay cepstral
	coefficients (MGDCC) and cosine normalized phase cepstral coefficients
	(CNPCC) with that of MGFCC. The experimental results on ASV spoof 2015
	database show that MGFCC outperforms magnitude based, MFCC and GFCC, and
	phase based, MGDCC and CNPCC, features on the known attack conditions.
	Further, we performed a score level fusion of the systems developed
	using MFCC, MGFCC, MGDCC and CNPCC. It is observed that the fused system
	significantly outperforms all the individual systems for known and
	unknown attack conditions of ASV spoof 2015 database.}},

	abstract={The Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature can be cast-off in speaker recognition. The process of feature extraction of the speech signal using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature vectors will generate an acoustic speech signal. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is frequently used as a classifier for Big Data related problems. In this research, we proposed a new model based on MFCC and LSH to integrate into speaker recognition model. The main returns of our newly proposed model are to get robustness, effective and accurate results in comparison with MFCC+GMM, LPCC+GMM and MFCC+PNN models. This model also contributes to the literature of Big Data. In this model, first, we extract the MFCC features from the wave file then we applied LSH classifier on extracted feature to transform into hash-table. Finally, the hash-tables of train and test wave files are compared and obtained 92.66% speaker recognition accuracy. We compared the accuracy ratio of proposed model with other traditional models namely MFCC+GMM, MFCC+PNN, and LPCC+GMM. Experimental results show that proposed model is more accurate and robust than traditional models and good for speaker recognition.},
